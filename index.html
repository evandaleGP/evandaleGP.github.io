					<h2>COVID Requirements</h2>
					<p>
						For all Face-to-Face appointments please arrive as close as possible to your appointment time. 5 minutes prior to scheduled appointment would be appreciated.  Regardless of your vaccination status; We ask you to NOT ENTER our practice if you:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Are waiting on your result for a Covid-19 test</li>
						<li>Have cold or flu-like symptoms including a <strong>fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, loss of taste and/or smell </strong> and <strong>shortness of breath</strong>. In this case on the day of your appointment we ask that at a minimum you return a negative RAT Test and that you wear a face mask prior to entering. Please ensure it covers your mouth and nose.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Telehealth is available to patients who are positive for covid 19/awaiting a result or have the above symptoms. A time slot will be booked with the GP and they will call you for a phone consultation at the allocated time. Practice staff will advise you if there will be an excessive delay in your appointment time. The Doctor will advise you if they assess you as requiring further Face-to-Face assessment. Our telehealth appointments follow the same fee structure as our Face-to-Face appointments. We do apologise, however due to Medicare rules If you have not been seen Face-to-Face at our practice previously or within the past 12 months you will not be eligible for a rebate from Medicare and your out-of-pocket cost will be 100% of our telehealth consult fee. </p>
