In 2011 Dr Annamalai returned to Australia working in General Practice in the local Launceston area before returning to the LGH in the Emergency Department where she met her nurse husband to be, Darren.

										<h3>Darren Bowkett (RN)</h3>
										<p>
											Darren was born in Launceston and grew up in the Northern suburbs. He attended Rocherlea Primary School, Brooks High, Alanvale College and went on to complete his Bachelor of Nursing at the University of Tasmania. His Father was a Painter and Decorator and his Mother a Diversional Therapist. 
Darren worked as Registered Nurse at the Launceston General Hospital from 2007 to 2017 and again from 2021 to 2022. The Majority of that time was spent working in the Emergency Department. In 2012 he met Vasuki who was at the time a Registrar in the Emergency department. They went on to marry in 2016 and now have 2 beautiful children.
Between 2017 and 2020 a move to the Mainland saw him working in Rural NSW, in towns such as Wee Waa (Cotton Capital of Australia), Narrabri, Tamworth (Country Music Capital) and Werris Creek. During that time working mainly in Emergency Departments (small and big) but a stint in General Practice working with Vasuki as her practice nurse. A stint that fired his interest in primary care which still remains. He returned to Tasmania in 2020 with his family.
Since Late 2022 he has been working in Urgent Care, a role he has embraced and enjoyed. When time permits he loves to bush walk and really just be in nature. He loves to spend as much time with family and like Vasuki that balance between work and family life is very important. “Tasmania is home for me and that feeling is very strongly imbedded in me”.

</br>
When she's not immersed in her work, Letitia is all about community and connection. You'll often find her cheering passionately for her local rugby team, showing off her community spirit.

					<h2>COVID Requirements</h2>
					<p>
						For all Face-to-Face appointments please arrive as close as possible to your appointment time. 5 minutes prior to scheduled appointment would be appreciated.  Regardless of your vaccination status; We ask you to NOT ENTER our practice if you:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Are waiting on your result for a Covid-19 test</li>
						<li>Have cold or flu-like symptoms including a <strong>fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, loss of taste and/or smell </strong> and <strong>shortness of breath</strong>. In this case on the day of your appointment we ask that at a minimum you return a negative RAT Test and that you wear a face mask prior to entering. Please ensure it covers your mouth and nose.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Telehealth is available to patients who are positive for covid 19/awaiting a result or have the above symptoms. A time slot will be booked with the GP and they will call you for a phone consultation at the allocated time. Practice staff will advise you if there will be an excessive delay in your appointment time. The Doctor will advise you if they assess you as requiring further Face-to-Face assessment. Our telehealth appointments follow the same fee structure as our Face-to-Face appointments. We do apologise, however due to Medicare rules If you have not been seen Face-to-Face at our practice previously or within the past 12 months you will not be eligible for a rebate from Medicare and your out-of-pocket cost will be 100% of our telehealth consult fee. </p>
